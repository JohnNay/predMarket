This file contains the monthly mean baseline (background) carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration,
"measured at the Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station (CGBAPS), ",
"located near the north-west tip of Tasmania, Australia.",
"CGBAPS is funded and managed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and",
the scientific program is jointly supervised with CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship.,
Please acknowledge these two institutions if these data are used in publications or presentations.,

,
The CO2 units are parts per million in dry air (ppm).,
,
The most recent year of data is provided in this file on,
a provisional basis only. These data may be subject to further revision. ,
CSIRO & the Bureau make every effort to produce the most accurate and ,
"precise measurements possible. However, they reserve the right to make",
